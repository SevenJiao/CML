The *Coded Modulation Library* (CML) is a library of communication system simulations developed at West Virginia University.
Key design points are
 * Implemented using a combination of MATLAB's high-level language and mex bindings to C functions
 * Free software licensed under the lesser GPL

Features

* Modulation : PSK, QAM, APSK, CPM (CPFSK)
* Channel Models : AWGN, Rayleigh fading (ergodic and block)
* Forward Error Correction : convolutional, turbo, block-turbo (BTC), LDPC, hybrid-ARQ
* User-specified LDPC parity-check matrices
* Information theoretic bounds : channel capacity, outage probability
